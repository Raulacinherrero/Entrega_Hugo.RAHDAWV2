## JavaScript interpreter

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It is not a programming language but a tool to communicate JavaScript and PHP, that is, make requests to your server, without the need to reload the page. Let's say it allows JavaScript to send a message to a PHP script, which will run on the server, without interfering with the execution of the page, and at the end send a response. We already know that JavaScript and PHP generally don't live together.

JavaScript, via AJAX, invokes a PHP script made to perform that query. While the page continues its normal execution, JavaScript continues to respond to events and allows you to continue interacting. JavaScript, while still running, kept listening for the AJAX request, until now it receives its response. JavaScript must know how to interpret that response, and based on it, present it to you in the browser.

## DNS server

The domain name system or DNS (Domain Name System) is a set of protocols and services that was created with the aim of saving users the effort of having to remember an IP address. Without a doubt, it is easier for us to remember a name, and also the numerical address could change for different reasons, without changing the name.

A DNS server is software that is responsible for translating IP addresses to domain names.

## HTTP Protocol

The HTTP protocol is an extensible protocol, ie "vocabulary" can be added. HTTP is based on a few basic concepts such as the concept of resources and URIs, a simple message structure, and a client-server architecture to order the flow of communications. In addition to these concepts, new ones have appeared throughout its development and functionalities and semantic rules have been added, creating new methods and headers.
