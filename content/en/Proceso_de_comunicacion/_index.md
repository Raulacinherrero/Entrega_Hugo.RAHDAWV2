When you start in the world of web programming, you realize that many times the pages are built with a mixture of several languages. If you come from the world of structured programming or desktop application programming, it is often confusing because you usually use only one language in your entire project. These languages are usually PHP, Javascript and HTML. Generally the other languages that are used in the development of web pages cover a niche of one of these 3 languages.

Also remember that web programming is a discipline that has been developing little by little. At first everything was HTML, but with the development of new technologies and the appearance of new standards, languages were added.
