The server that generates the page must be able to understand the PHP language. Remember that when you load a web page, everything starts on the server that contains said page. This machine is the one in charge of creating and providing your machine with the web page. PHP takes the information we want from a database, or simply builds a page according to certain parameters and variables.

That is, PHP generates HTML and Javascript code. Generally PHP is used as a code generator. Once it has created the page, PHP sends the result to the browser and its work is finished. Our browsers do not understand the PHP code, it is executed on the server.

This is why no PHP code is delivered to your browser, otherwise all PHP code would be ignored. It would appear as source code.
